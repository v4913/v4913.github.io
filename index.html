	<p>Hi! I'm Vivian Loh (also known as v4913), a math nerd who enjoys thinking about philosophy and being extremely random and whimsical.
	I'm a second year student at Caltech, who grew up in Pittsburgh. I study pure math, and particularly enjoy combinatorics, 
		abstract algebra, and <a href="/math.html">olympiad geometry</a>, but I'm also interested in learning more about the applications 
		of math to CS and physics. I enjoy reading peoples' writing and blogs, and I have a <a href="https://athemath.org/" target="_blank">blog</a> 
		on Substack that I like to post random musings + life updates on!</p>
	<p>I'm also involved in the nonprofit <a href="https://athemath.org/" target="_blank">Athemath</a> supporting girls in math, and I used to be
	 a <a href="https://live.poshenloh.com/" target="_blank">LIVE</a> instructor. I really love yapping with interesting people and seeing
		 the world.</p>
	<p>Some other hobbies I have are teaching, listening to EDM, and some forms of art such as drawing. I would say I don't have many
	 hobbies compared to most people, though, which is something I want to change. Some other things I want to improve on are becoming more
	 social + better at communication, fitness, coding, and Mandarin.</p>
